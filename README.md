# Inspiration
I’ve always been passionate about music and how it brings people together. Spotify has been a big part of my life, helping me discover new songs, connect with artists, and share playlists with friends. The way Spotify makes it so easy to find and enjoy music has always inspired me.

That’s why I decided to create a very simple Spotify clone. I wanted to understand the magic behind the app that I use every day and to challenge myself to build something similar from scratch. It was important to me to create a project that reflects my love for music and my appreciation for the technology that makes it all possible.

Building this clone has been an amazing learning experience. I got to dive deep into how music streaming works, from the user interface to managing playlists and handling audio files. This project isn’t just about copying Spotify; it’s about showing my respect for what it represents and pushing myself to grow as a developer.
